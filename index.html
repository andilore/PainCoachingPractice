			If you're here, you or 					someone you love has probably 			been in chronic pain for 				several weeks, months, or 				years, with no end in 					sight.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Many of the following may 				resonate with you:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You've been prescribed 					several medications, but 				none have resolved your 				pain - they've only 					managed it, at best</li>
			<li>You've tried several 					alternative therapies 					outside Western 						medicine, still to no 					avail</li>
			<li>You've been told your 					symptoms can only be 					managed, and that 						there's no cure</li>
			<li>You've stopped working 					and/or taking part in 					the things you love, 					because the pain is so 					bad</li>
			<li>You've shrunk your life 				down to the bare 						minimum, in attempt to 					get ahold of your pain 					and symptoms</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			But I'm here to tell you that 			in many cases, chronic pain 			is curable.  You can get your 			life back once and for all.
			<br>						 			Learn more about how your 				chronic pain may be curable.
